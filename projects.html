						<h4>Samidha is working in the field of Education for almost a decade. Samidha is working on various interesting researches
							in the Education sector. We are focusing on the Research oriented implementation of the Education programs.</h4>
						<h3>Samidha Projects</h3>
						<h4>Learning Community</h4>
						<p>We are looking towards the Education beyond schooling and trying to develop community learning spaces. It will be continuous
							learning environment where learning will be immersed completely into the daily activities of the children. We are
							using Critical Pedagogy to make sure that children become change makers and find solutions to problems in their vicinity.
							We have started our projects on this thought in the remote locations of Nagpur districts.</p>
						<h4>Baseline Study for Goa state</h4>
						<p>Samidha is working on Baseline Study for ‘Mulyavardhan’ program owned by Goa SCERT. ‘Mulyavardhan’ is a value education
							program to help school-going children imbibe democratic values, attitudes and skills in an enabling school climate.
							There were 24 members and 12 BRPs on the field in 12 Talukas of Goa state during this study. Government officials
							also appreciated our professionalism, commitment and way of working.</p>
						<h3>Other Projects</h3>
						<h4>Muktachand</h4>
						<p>Among other qualities, parents try to inculcate social awareness in children from a very young age. Samidha organize
							a 2 day recreational summer/winter workshop with the same objective for age group of 10 -15 years. Its tough job making
							it interesting and we thoroughly enjoye it.</p>
						<h4>Raddi collection</h4>
						<p>Inspired by an article in a newspaper we started collecting Raddi, scrap paper, from willing households. The money
							collected from selling it is donated for many causes including funding Mai’s orphanages. Many times we also find good
							books and magazines which are donated in old-age homes and orphanages.</p>
						<h4>Anti Child-Begging Campaign (ACBC)</h4>
						<p>Dream India and Samidha, two organizations working for social causes came together to brighten the future of children
							begging on the street. The easy money they earn by black-mailing us with those teary eyes is more tempting than education.
							One way around it is for us to stop giving them money. It was a wonderful experience working with Dream India and
							media partner Radio Mirchi.</p>
						<h4>Plantation Drive</h4>
						<p>It has been our pleasure to help our partner organization, Vasundhara Swatchhata Abhiyan, in their effort to fight
							global warming through greener hills around pune.</p>
						This time, in co-operation from a few companies in pune, we were able to successfully carry out a plantation drive on Baner
						Hills on the outskirts of Pune.</p>
						<h4>Sinhagadavar Ek Sakal (A beautiful morning on Fort Sinhagad)</h4>
						<p>One fine day, one of our members came up with the idea of cleaning a social place we all like to visit, SINHGAD FORT.
							Then what? Decision is made and a drive is carried out with full enthusiasm. The best part was when other tourists
							joined to help make it a cleaner place to come back to.</p>
						<h4>Computer literacy</h4>
						<p>As we read information on a website and considering computers are very much a part of our lives, it is hard to imagine
							some of us may not have this fortune. In areas in India where computer is still a myth, we try to provide the opportunity
							to catch up with technology by providing computer education. Currently we are giving free computer fundamental classes
							in places with our reach with whatever resources we can put together.</p>
						<h4>Charity show at Bharat natya mandir</h4>
						<p>Samidha organized a charity show to raise funds for Mai’s work. It would not have been possible without the artists
							from the four college groups that performed their award winning performances from the prestigious drama competition
							‘Firodiya Karandak’. We sincerely acknowledge the response given by the people of Pune as they turned up in huge numbers
							to enjoy themselves and bring smiles to others less fortunate</p>
						<h4>SWACH</h4>
						<p>SWaCH Pune Seva Sahakari Sanstha, established by KKPKP (Kagad Kach Patra Kashtakari Panchayat), is an autonomous enterprise
							of waste pickers that provides front end waste management solutions to the citizens of Pune and is authorized to provide
							Door to Door Waste Collection and waste management services by the Pune Municipal Corporation. Samidha conducted promotional
							drives for SWaCH in few areas of Pune.</p>
						<h4>Women’s Day celebration</h4>
						<p>Samidhians celebrated Women’s Day 2008 by bringing joy to their own lives. It was a great pleasure to spend time with
							the residents of ‘Nivara’, a home for the elderly, in Pune. We went with the intention of giving them a few minutes
							of laughter, but we came back with lots more love they gave us. The gain was ours than theirs.</p>
						<h4>Visit Orphanage</h4>
						<p>Every weekend, members of Samidha, visit an orphanage SOFOSH to spend time with the kids, play with them and bring
							smiles to their life. It’s a way of earning joy for us and a gesture of appreciation for those who work hard to give
							these children a better life.</p>
						<h4>Begging for a great cause – Mai</h4>
						<p>A proud mother of 1000+ children, Mai (Sindhutai Sapkal). This remarkable social work who stood against all odds to
							promise a better life for street orphans inspired us in our efforts to do our best. We began and continue to raise
							funds for Mai. Thus started our first activity in May 2007.</p>
						<h4>Melghat Workshop</h4>
						<p>Melghat is a remote village in the northern part of Maharashtra, which loses its contact with the world in extreme
							climatic conditions, A group called maître helps the villagers there with various kinds of activities that could improve
							living conditions in extreme climate. Students of Colorado University volunteer annually at Melghat through maître.
							Samidha members helped with the activities and acted as translators for the foreign students. Thus three different
							people brought a little convenience to the lives in Melghat.</p>
						<h4>Volunteering at Hemalkasa</h4>
						<p>It is our honor to have worked with Magsaysay awardee Prakashabhau Amte and Vandatai Amte in this 15 day workshop aimed
							at creating awareness among youth about hard work (shram anee mehnat) and social responsibilities and how to work
							towards it.</p>
