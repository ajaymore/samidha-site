                        <div>Am I social creature? Are we socially senstive? Do we care of the society thatwe belong to? Aren't
                            we responsible to enrich our culture?</div>
                        </br>
                        <p class="align-left">In the search of answers to these very fundamental questions and alike, we tossed an idea to unite
                            for revealing the meaning of socially sensitive world. To start with we started working on the
                            facts and some social entities working in the surrounding, very first was the SOFOSH, a child
                            orphanage run by Sasoon Hospital caring almost about 75 children that time all ranging from 0-6
                            age group. Majority of the initial volunteers were from IT/Software companies and to compare
                            the reality at SOFOSH and the lifestyle that was there in IT/Softwares, it was like 2 pollar
                            ends of the life. We kept visiting the orphanage to learn the problem context and depth of the
                            sesitivity of it. We also borrowed some of our initial inspiration from Sindhutai Sapkal(Maai)
                            and also raised some funds for them.</p>
                        <p class="align-left"> We started few projects in slum areas around computer literacy. We joined hands with Khelghar and
                            Palakniti to deep dive in the issues in and around child education area. With this diversified
                            experience, we decided to form a registered trust to get our intentions and efforts formalized.
                            It was almost 10 years back that we signed of this endless journey to learn about the social
                            elements in our surrounding, there interaction patterns, actions and reactions, then from that
                            learning we could identify some key areas that needed the intensive care.</p>
                        <p class="align-left"> Finally, we actually pushed ourselves on the field to make the difference. As part of our field work
                            we executed lot many short term and long term activities that made it to our portfolio. some
                            of them are still ongoing as continuous activities.
